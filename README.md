## Deliverable 1
### 	Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset? 
#### Vehicle length, ground clearance, AWD
### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not? 
#### No bc the coefficients are not zero and the P value is very small.
### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not? 
#### Somewhat because r^2 value of 0.68 is closer to 1 than 0. 
## Deliverable 2  
#### 	The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. 
### Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?  
#### Yes because the variance is less than 1.  
## Deliverable 2 Summary
#### ![D2 summary](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97294789/172084528-0839028d-5399-49a2-8245-0f86f11ce689.jpeg)
## Deliverable 3 
### briefly summarize your interpretation and findings for the t-test results. Include screenshots of the t-test to support your summary. 
#### 	Total sample Not statistically different because it is over 0.05 
#### Lot 1 Not statistically different because it is over 0.05 
#### Lot 2 not statistically different because it is over 0.05 
#### Lot 3 is statistically different because it is under 0.05 
## Deliverable 4  
### I will test the predictors of linear regression
### What metric or metrics are you going to test? 
#### We will do a linear regression test with MPG, cost, and horsepower as dependent variables and the independent variable will be the weight, length, wheel size, trim level, horsepower. 
### What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?  
#### Null hypothesis is the dependent variables correlate to the independent variables with P < 0.01 
### What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?  
#### Linear regression looking at P values. 
### What data is needed to run the statistical test? 
#### Multiple models from the competition providing dependent variable and independent variable.
